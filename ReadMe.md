# ArchBuilder
ArchBuilder is a library of tools aimed at providing automated support for software design, evaluation and communication.

## Supported Platforms
ArchBuilder has only support for desktop

## Documentation

## RoadMap
<h3>At it's maturity the application should achieve the following:</h3>

- Map requirements to probable design options,
- Provide machine learning capabilities to learn from past design choices and improve the quality of future designs
- Automate design tasks, 
- Provide pre-designed templates, 
- Assess quality attributes, 
- Enable traceability of design decisions to requirements, and create formal models. 
- Support communication and collaboration, 
- Version control and change management,
- Documentation and reporting, 
- Integration with other tools,
- Continuous improvement and optimization.

## Catalogue section by Isaac
-This is repository or database of predefined architectural components or patterns 
 that can be used to quickly build and design software systems. These can include things like modules, interfaces, classes, 
 and functions, as well as architectural styles such as client-server, microservices, and event-driven architectures.
 
_Steps we could follow to create one are:-_
1.Determine the types of components and patterns to include.
2.Organize components and patterns (by architectural styles, programming language, function, or other relevant criteria)
3.Create a database. (Something like where to store these components as they are displayed)
4.Define metadata (Extra information)
5.Implement search functionality (To quicken work at user end, for user experience)
6.Maintain and update (With new trends, fixing errors, etc)
